## About this project ##

A development environment prototype for Android tablets.
Created during a diploma thesis.

  * **Operating System:** Android
  * **Minimum OS Version:** 3.3
  * **Tested on hardware:** Motorola Xoom tablet

| The design and development process is described in my diploma thesis, which is available here as a PDF: | <a href='http://scratchtab.googlecode.com/files/ScratchTab%20diploma%20thesis.pdf'>PDF</a>|

The aim of this work was to examine the question of whether the block programming
language metaphor is suitable for touch interfaces, by
creating a working prototype of a block programming language
for Android OS driven tablets.

Block programming language was chosen as a development environment for this project, because
they are well qualified to learn the
basics of programming, since they are capable to prevent the
user from making syntactical errors, if the logical constraints are
used properly. This is important, because touch interface does not provide the efficiency of desktop programming environments, and so the programming novices were considered as the target group of this project.

The accentuation was made on the
design and development, however in the last chapters of this work the initial evaluation on whether the users are more
motivated by using block programming language on tablets,
than on static desktop computers are made too.

The outcome of this project is a prototype, which has passed the
first user tests and the evaluation of the prototypes interface and
itâ€™s effect on the user tests participants. The participants showed
a great motivation on the project idea, the prototype was graded
as exciting during the final user study.

On the picture there is the prototype GUI. The colors were chosen randomly and temporary, but there's nothing so permanent as temporary :)

<h2>This project as a framework</h2>
The whole ScratchTab application has become a framework with
the aim of supporting the ScratchTab developer in designing new
programming blocks which can then be combined by ScratchTab
users to new scripts. To define a new block one must define

  1. How the block should look like.
  1. What command should be represented by the block.

## Lego NXT Robot ##
The ability of controlling the Lego NXT robot was added to
ScratchTab in order of giving a playful and vivid task to the
ScratchTab programmers. In ScratchTab there are several Blocks
with embedded Lego NXT commands.
Lego NXT is a robotic kit. Itâ€™s components are:

  * The NXT Intelligent Brick, which is a brick-shaped computer, which is capable to control up-to 4 connected motors.
  * Step motors
  * Sound, touch, light and ultrasonic sensors. Within the framework of this project the upper components were used
in the combination which is depicted on figure.
